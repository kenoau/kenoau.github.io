# THE Australian Keno Monitor MARK POLICY

## General Guidelines

The purpose of the Australian Keno Monitor mark policy is to encourage the widespread use of
Australian Keno Monitor marks by the community while controlling the use of the marks in
order to avoid confusion on the part of software users and the general public,
to maintain the value of the image and reputation of the marks and to protect
them from inappropriate or unauthorized use.

Any use of any Australian Keno Monitor mark must be in accordance with this policy. Any use
that does not comply with our trademark policy is not authorized.

Marks cover the following items: The name "Australian Keno Monitor", the Australian Keno Monitor emblem
(without text) and the Australian Keno Monitor logo (with word art text).

Do not assume that this policy will answer every question about the use of Red
Eclipse marks, if in doubt, contact the Australian Keno Monitor project.

## Declaration

1. For the purposes of tax, trademarks, copyrights, and ownership, Australian Keno Monitor
   is considered to be the property of Mr Quinton Reeves as sole proprietor
   executed from the province of Australia, as is produced as a hobby project
   for no profit.

2. For the purposes of identifying adjoining identifying names for tax,
   trademarks, copyrights, and ownership, the following terms are considered
   synonymous with the sole proprietor of the project, Mr Quinton Reeves:
   - Australian Keno Monitor
   - Australian Keno Monitor Community

## Permitted Use

You may use the marks without prior written permission (subject to the following
terms):

1. To refer to the Australian Keno Monitor software in substantially unmodified form.

  "Substantially unmodified" for source code means built from the source code
  provided by The Australian Keno Monitor project, possibly with minor modifications
  including but not limited to: the enabling or disabling of certain features by
  default, translations into other languages, changes required for compatibility
  with a particular operating system distribution, the inclusion of bug-fix
  patches, or the bundling of additional extensions.

2. To identify Australian Keno Monitor as a distinct component of a software offering.

3. To factually refer to The Australian Keno Monitor project itself, its products, or its
   protocols.

   Example: You may use "Bob's Add-ons for Australian Keno Monitor" or
            "Bob's forum for Australian Keno Monitor" but not "Bob's Australian Keno Monitor".

4. When referring to Australian Keno Monitor that is substantially modified, to say
   that such software is a "derivative of" or "based on" Australian Keno Monitor. You may
   use the marks as part of the name of a product designed to work with Red
   Eclipse, so long as the name as a whole (via its other components) clearly
   and unambiguously distinguishes the product from Australian Keno Monitor, and the
   general presentation of the product does not imply any official association
   or identity with the Australian Keno Monitor project.


## Non Permitted Use

You may not use the marks in the following ways:

1. In any way likely to cause confusion as to the identity of the Australian Keno Monitor
   project, the origin of its software, or the software's license.

2. In any way that indicates a greater degree of association between you and
   Australian Keno Monitor project than actually exists.

3. In any way that implies a designated successor to Australian Keno Monitor
   (e.g., "Australian Keno Monitor++" is not permitted).

4. In any way that indicates that the Australian Keno Monitor project favours one
   distribution, platform, product, etc. over another except where explicitly
   indicated in writing by the Australian Keno Monitor project.

5. In any way that promotes the use of third party services over those provided
   by Australian Keno Monitor.

6. In any way that could be deemed harmful or disruptive to the Australian Keno Monitor
   community and/or project.

Thus uses of the marks in a domain name or company name without explicit written
permission from the Australian Keno Monitor project are prohibited.

## Other Legal Notes

The Australian Keno Monitor project reserves the sole right to:

1. Determine compliance with this policy.

2. Modify this policy to preserve the rights of Australian Keno Monitor, the public, the
   community, and the users.
   The latest version of the Australian Keno Monitor Mark Policy should be available at
   <https://kenoau.redeclipse.net/wiki/Trademark_Policy>

3. Grant exceptions to this policy, of any kind and for any reason whatsoever,
   other clauses notwithstanding.

## Other Use

If you have questions regarding the policy, or if any of the examples are
unclear, feel free to contact the Australian Keno Monitor project using the details provided
in the declaration above.

If you would like to use the Australian Keno Monitor marks for any other use, please contact
us and we'll discuss a way to make that happen. We don't have strong objections
to people using the name for their websites and businesses, but we do need the
chance to review such use.

In other words, it's not a big deal, and a short conversation (via the forums
for example) should clear everything up in short order.

If you currently have a product that is using the Australian Keno Monitor marks in a way
that don't follow this policy, don't panic. Let us know, and we'll work it out,
as described above.
